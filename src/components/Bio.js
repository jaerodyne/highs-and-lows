						Jillian Somera and the Beta Option has come a long way since their inception in 2015. Founded by Jillian Somera, the band was initially a solo project for the singer-songwriter. Somera wrote and composed all her songs on the guitar, taking musical influences from Amy Winehouse, Incubus, and John Mayer alike, forging a sound that Jillian herself refers to as Alternative Rock/R&B.

						It wasn’t until her time at Columbia College Chicago’s music program that the project evolved into a band setting. Somera first enlisted her fellow classmate, Justin Rosado, to play bass for her EP release party. Their performance forged the start of Jillian Somera and the Beta Option and they began their search for the ever-elusive permanent drummer. After cycling through various drummers, they finally settled on fellow classmate Austin Deadman, completing the 3-piece outfit that they are today.

						To date, the band has performed at various venues around Chicago, such as The Wire, House of Blues Foundation Room, Bottom Lounge, and the Elbo Room. Currently, they are in the studio finishing up their debut album, Highs and Lows, and are planning to have a release party on August 11th, 2018.
