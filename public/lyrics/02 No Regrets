02 No Regrets

We fall in and out of love
Like we missed our moment
And we’re trying to get it back each time
But sometimes

You don’t get second chances
Sometimes you only get to try once
And if you realize it too late
Those regrets stay with you forever

And sometimes I feel bad for you
But I can’t help myself
You deserve it
But it’s up to you to decide when you want to stop punishing yourself

Cause I forgave you long ago
Story’s been told don’t you know?
There’s no use in thinking about what could’ve been
Cause all we have are battles we weren’t meant to win

So if there’s ever a shadow of a doubt
Just let me bask in the afternoon glow
You owe it to me
To tell me what I need to know
Just say leave and I will go 2x

And I’m thinking so clearly now
You were the best thing that I never had
