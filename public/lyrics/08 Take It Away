08 Take It Away

It's not what they said
I can be who I want
It's all in my head
A perfect storm floods it all
And if I could break down these words
Assess the damage
I'd be right where I was
So who are you?
Why'd you come here tonight?

But help me I've gone too far again

So long to the words unspoken
So long to the promise broken
So long 'cause I gave it all I've got
Give in to this vibrant madness
Slow down rising to the surface
'Cause you could only hold me down for so long
But help us we've gone too far again

And do you want more from me?
I said do you want more from me?
'Cause if you just asked
Well I would
I'd give it to ya

So take it away
Take it away
Take me away
Take it away

But help us we've gone too far again
