04 There's Nobody Singing

Excuse me while I collect myself
'Cause lately I've been falling apart
Don't know what I'm doing
Don't know where I should go
I'm lost caught in the undertow

Bright lights blinding me
On and off they go
Sudden darkness envelopes my soul
Keep on smiling
'Cause I'm putting on a show
The charade ends as the curtains close

The days pass by
I'm floating through life
Just a passerby
Will I sink or swim
Drifting into sleep
Wondering what's the next day like
Hear a lullaby
But there's nobody singing to me now

I'm waiting for my second wind
Some inspired revelation
Anything to get out of this twisted situation
Come up standing tall
Getting back into that grind
Fighting back the enemy that is my troubled mind

Chorus

But there's nobody singing to me now
