01 Watch Out Boys

In this place
I found something
I couldn’t bear to keep
A secret buried deep
In a man’s broken heart

Doomed from that start
A longing never to be realized
A woman he idealized
And unmet expectations

Watch out boys
Cause you’ll never have her
Watch out boys
Cause you’ll never catch her

And she’ll act like she didn’t notice
Like you didn’t want this to turn out a different way
Cause what you could you really say?
Oh but you’ll keep trying
Oh you swear she won’t get away

And after all that you’ve done
Well you still won’t be the one
She wants forever
Never means never
And that’s just the way it is
That’s just the way it is

But what’s it to you?
(It’s not my place to say)
What’s it to you?
(It’s not my place to say)
