11 Out to Sea

Knew a boy and they sent him out to sea
Told him it would teach him how to be a man
So they dressed him up in colors
And taught him how to fight
Now he's off defending somebody else's rights

But what about his own? 4x
Well what about it?

He's made his decision there's no turning back
There's nothing that anyone can say
So father, mother, brother, sister please understand
He's waging war against lost souls and burying them in the sand

But what about the cost? 4x
Well he doesn't think about it

Couldn't speak or breathe or even comprehend the total struggle
Fighting with himself and everybody else
But he's never been so sure that the poison has a cure
So he holds on swears he'll make it to the end

But what's it all for? 4x

What about all those promises you made
The love you gave
And everybody else you're leaving behind

And the rain comes down
With the weight that he bears
But he's been conditioned to accept the dares
That test his strength and will
And that gives him the license to kill
Just don't lose yourself to the greater good
Like so many others 4x
But I know he knows what I know

But if we're fighting a losing battle
How many more must we send out to sea?
