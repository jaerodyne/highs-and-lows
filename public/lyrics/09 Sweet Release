09 Sweet Release

Another bottle
Ready to burst
A volatile moment
Where you're the worst
And you can't deal with it

An unfocused mind
Bordering insanity
But everything is real to me

Let go and let this sweet release
Take control
And let's see how far we can go
How far we can go

Wrapped up in hindsight
Regretting unspoken words
Couldn't you ever tell the truth?
An honest man
Betraying himself
It's all we can do to survive

(Back to Chorus)

He never even heard her leave

Oh and I swear that this is the last time
Oh and I swear that this is the last lie
But I just don't know 2x
I just don't know
