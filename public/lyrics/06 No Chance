06 No Chance

Let's think for a second if you care
Expect to see you standing there
Trying to find reasons why
I stuck around just to dry out hanging on a string
That you laid out for wounds to sting
Open hearts are yours to break
There's no give just a lot of take

Chorus:
'Cause I stand no chance when it comes to you
'Cause you'd rather keep our secrets in the dark corners of your mind
And you prefer your busy life
And pushing me aside
'Cause I'm nothing to you
But I gave you everything I had

I'm only writing words
Having this conversation with myself
Feeling the dusty item you left on the shelf
Of your life
And it won't be long before you throw me up
You've used me up and drained me dry
There's no explanation why

(Back to Chorus)

How does it feel?
To know that you're always gonna be alone? 2x

How does it feel?
Well how do you feel?
I guess I'll never really know

Oooh
'Cause I stand no chance against you
