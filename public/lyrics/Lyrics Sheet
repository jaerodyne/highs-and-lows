Watch Out Boys

In this place
I found something
I couldn’t bear to keep
A secret buried deep
In a man’s broken heart

Doomed from that start
A longing never to be realized
A woman he idealized
And unmet expectations

Watch out boys
Cause you’ll never have her
Watch out boys
Cause you’ll never catch her

And she’ll act like she didn’t notice
Like you didn’t want this to turn out a different way
Cause what you could you really say?
Oh but you’ll keep trying
Oh you swear she won’t get away

And after all that you’ve done
Well you still won’t be the one
She wants forever
Never means never
And that’s just the way it is
That’s just the way it is

But what’s it to you?
(It’s not my place to say)
What’s it to you?
(It’s not my place to say)

No Regrets

We fall in and out of love
Like we missed our moment
And we’re trying to get it back each time
But sometimes

You don’t get second chances
Sometimes you only get to try once
And if you realize it too late
Those regrets stay with you forever

And sometimes I feel bad for you
But I can’t help myself
You deserve it
But it’s up to you to decide when you want to stop punishing yourself

Cause I forgave you long ago
Story’s been told don’t you know?
There’s no use in thinking about what could’ve been
Cause all we have are battles we weren’t meant to win

So if there’s ever a shadow of a doubt
Just let me bask in the afternoon glow
You owe it to me
To tell me what I need to know
Just say leave and I will go 2x

And I’m thinking so clearly now
You were the best thing that I never had

Superstar

Hey there superstar
Where you going?
The lights are still on and the spotlight's on you

You've got an hour to kill
To impress and to thrill
This is your moment
This is what you've wanted your whole life long

But when you think about it
Struggle's more than it's worth
Pushes you to the end
But far is far enough
When you're nearly falling over the edge

Chorus:
But who are you now
On the big stage
When the people you left behind
Don't know you anymore

But it's never bothered you before
Because you know
You have to do what you have to do
To get to where you are
Isn't that right superstar?

Whoa no

Convince yourself
It must be the stress
The pressure's getting to you
You haven't slept in days
And your mind's in a daze
Asking questions like

(Back to Chorus)

Bridge:
Better better
Better that they take the fall for you
Better better
One more drink and the night is through
Better better
You'll find a way to make it day by bay
Better better
It's what you'll never feel

Whoa oh

Last Chorus:
But who are you now on the big stage
When the people
You left behind
Don't know you
(Superstar)
Don't know you
(Where you going?)
When you don't know yourself anymore
(The lights are still on)

There's Nobody Singing

Excuse me while I collect myself
'Cause lately I've been falling apart
Don't know what I'm doing
Don't know where I should go
I'm lost caught in the undertow

Bright lights blinding me
On and off they go
Sudden darkness envelopes my soul
Keep on smiling
'Cause I'm putting on a show
The charade ends as the curtains close

The days pass by
I'm floating through life
Just a passerby
Will I sink or swim
Drifting into sleep
Wondering what's the next day like
Hear a lullaby
But there's nobody singing to me now

I'm waiting for my second wind
Some inspired revelation
Anything to get out of this twisted situation
Come up standing tall
Getting back into that grind
Fighting back the enemy that is my troubled mind

Chorus

But there's nobody singing to me now

05 A Secret to Tell

I've got a secret to tell but I won't tell anyone
'Cause why would I want to show you how deep my scars run
There's a darkness inside that I never could believe
Don't you know
You'll never really know me 'cause you'll

Run away
'Cause you'll
Run away

And I'll keep the thoughts to myself
Buried underneath
Fighting to surface
Drowning in the deep
If only I could show you
If only I could tell you
It wouldn't make a difference at all
'Cause I'll

Run away
'Cause you'll
Run away

And if I find that you stay
Well I'll be so inclined to leave
It's in my nature
'Cause it's one or the other
And I just don't
Trust myself with loving you

No no no no

06 No Chance

Let's think for a second if you care
Expect to see you standing there
Trying to find reasons why
I stuck around just to dry out hanging on a string
That you laid out for wounds to sting
Open hearts are yours to break
There's no give just a lot of take

Chorus:
'Cause I stand no chance when it comes to you
'Cause you'd rather keep our secrets in the dark corners of your mind
And you prefer your busy life
And pushing me aside
'Cause I'm nothing to you
But I gave you everything I had

I'm only writing words
Having this conversation with myself
Feeling the dusty item you left on the shelf
Of your life
And it won't be long before you throw me up
You've used me up and drained me dry
There's no explanation why

(Back to Chorus)

How does it feel?
To know that you're always gonna be alone? 2x

How does it feel?
Well how do you feel?
I guess I'll never really know

Oooh
'Cause I stand no chance against you

07 It's Over

Knew that there was something wrong
Couldn't keep it from me for too long
You're not strong enough to
Continue lying to me
Everybody knows that everything is different now
And I just gotta let you walk away

'Cause everything is not alright 
But I gotta believe it can be
So go on
Just get out of my life
'Cause I'm not gonna follow you
To your way down
Stop bringing me down
I've gotta separate myself somehow

Didn't have a second thought
Just focused on the things you sought
Your heartless just doesn't make any sense to me
'Cause I remember who you used to be
Of how you would never do that
Of how the thought would never cross your mind

But it's over
How could I ever call you a friend?
It's over
Don't think I ever want to see you again
I wanted to tell you that I
Can't even look at you
Without fighting urges to cry
You just seem so far away
And I want you to stay there

Leave me alone
I'm through

08 Take It Away

It's not what they said
I can be who I want
It's all in my head
A perfect storm floods it all
And if I could break down these words
Assess the damage
I'd be right where I was
So who are you?
Why'd you come here tonight?

But help me I've gone too far again

So long to the words unspoken
So long to the promise broken
So long 'cause I gave it all I've got
Give in to this vibrant madness
Slow down rising to the surface
'Cause you could only hold me down for so long
But help us we've gone too far again

And do you want more from me?
I said do you want more from me?
'Cause if you just asked
Well I would
I'd give it to ya

So take it away
Take it away
Take me away
Take it away

But help us we've gone too far again

09 Sweet Release

Another bottle
Ready to burst
A volatile moment
Where you're the worst
And you can't deal with it

An unfocused mind
Bordering insanity
But everything is real to me

Let go and let this sweet release
Take control
And let's see how far we can go
How far we can go

Wrapped up in hindsight
Regretting unspoken words
Couldn't you ever tell the truth?
An honest man
Betraying himself
It's all we can do to survive

(Back to Chorus)

He never even heard her leave

Oh and I swear that this is the last time
Oh and I swear that this is the last lie
But I just don't know 2x
I just don't know

10 You Can't Save Me

I can't believe I did it again
Put you above everything again
I expected too much
And you fell short again

I'm an optimist
But your attitude turns me cynical
Always judging
So hypercritical
How can I have faith when all you do is disappoint me?

But it's hard because you bring out the worst in me
And all I want to do is hurt you
To make you feel the way that I feel
And I don't want to be this way
But I can't help but say what I need to say

Tried to do everything right
But I always get it wrong
Self-destruct because this drink's too strong
Every drop is honey to the muse that sings along
So here's a toast to you and my loneliness
A toast to the ghost and the demon enchantress
'Cause I've been seduced by the darkness again
The light is dimming this hole is sinking
And at this point 
I've got to stop thinking
That I'm so alone

(Back to Chorus)

And I know
You can't save me
You can't save me
'Cause I
I can't even save myself
No no I can't even save myself
Ooooh

11 Out to Sea

Knew a boy and they sent him out to sea
Told him it would teach him how to be a man
So they dressed him up in colors
And taught him how to fight
Now he's off defending somebody else's rights

But what about his own? 4x
Well what about it?

He's made his decision there's no turning back
There's nothing that anyone can say
So father, mother, brother, sister please understand
He's waging war against lost souls and burying them in the sand

But what about the cost? 4x
Well he doesn't think about it

Couldn't speak or breathe or even comprehend the total struggle
Fighting with himself and everybody else
But he's never been so sure that the poison has a cure
So he holds on swears he'll make it to the end

But what's it all for? 4x

What about all those promises you made
The love you gave
And everybody else you're leaving behind

And the rain comes down
With the weight that he bears
But he's been conditioned to accept the dares
That test his strength and will
And that gives him the license to kill
Just don't lose yourself to the greater good
Like so many others 4x
But I know he knows what I know

But if we're fighting a losing battle
How many more must we send out to sea?

12 Insomnia

My mind is taking me over again
Going through all the possibilities
Don't think I'll ever get your voice out of my head
A guilty conscience feeds my insecurities

But I can't back down now

Oh insomnia
These sleepless nights take away all sanity
Oh insomnia
Stay awake 'cause you keep me up in the dead of night
All the way til the dawning of daylight

Tired 'cause I can't think about this anymore
Gotta find another distraction
I'm focusing on what I shouldn't
Fell apart 'cause I just couldn't
Keep it all together for so long

But I can't back down now

(Back to Chorus)

13 Never Forget

One more drink
That's all it took
He grabbed the wheel
As his hands shook
The coldness of the devil
Breathing him in
Consuming all the fight that's within

Losing focus
Blackened skies
Early morning
To sunrise
It all happened so fast 
and then time stood still
As the rushing of blood to the head knocked him dead
And it's lights out
Lights out
Lights out

Never forget
That it matters
Never forget
What you what you did
Never forget
I'll never let you live it down

And it feels like forever
Recovering from a big mistake
Faced with your mortality
Forgetting its fragility
But we all lose touch sometimes
(We all lose touch sometimes)
It could be our own demise
(It could be our own demise)

We're not invincible that's for sure
And that's just the way it goes
It goes
It goes

Every moment has a consequence
Stealing away all the innocence
Of a life so pure
Of a life so pure
Now it's tainted by a memory
Of you just washing over me
Do you even know?
How could you ever really know?
Could you ever really know?

(Back to Chorus)
