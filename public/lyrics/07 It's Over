07 It's Over

Knew that there was something wrong
Couldn't keep it from me for too long
You're not strong enough to
Continue lying to me
Everybody knows that everything is different now
And I just gotta let you walk away

'Cause everything is not alright 
But I gotta believe it can be
So go on
Just get out of my life
'Cause I'm not gonna follow you
To your way down
Stop bringing me down
I've gotta separate myself somehow

Didn't have a second thought
Just focused on the things you sought
Your heartless just doesn't make any sense to me
'Cause I remember who you used to be
Of how you would never do that
Of how the thought would never cross your mind

But it's over
How could I ever call you a friend?
It's over
Don't think I ever want to see you again
I wanted to tell you that I
Can't even look at you
Without fighting urges to cry
You just seem so far away
And I want you to stay there

Leave me alone
I'm through
