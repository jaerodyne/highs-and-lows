03 Superstar

Hey there superstar
Where you going?
The lights are still on and the spotlight's on you

You've got an hour to kill
To impress and to thrill
This is your moment
This is what you've wanted your whole life long

But when you think about it
Struggle's more than it's worth
Pushes you to the end
But far is far enough
When you're nearly falling over the edge

Chorus:
But who are you now
On the big stage
When the people you left behind
Don't know you anymore

But it's never bothered you before
Because you know
You have to do what you have to do
To get to where you are
Isn't that right superstar?

Whoa no

Convince yourself
It must be the stress
The pressure's getting to you
You haven't slept in days
And your mind's in a daze
Asking questions like

(Back to Chorus)

Bridge:
Better better
Better that they take the fall for you
Better better
One more drink and the night is through
Better better
You'll find a way to make it day by bay
Better better
It's what you'll never feel

Whoa oh
