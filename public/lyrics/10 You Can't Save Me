10 You Can't Save Me

I can't believe I did it again
Put you above everything again
I expected too much
And you fell short again

I'm an optimist
But your attitude turns me cynical
Always judging
So hypercritical
How can I have faith when all you do is disappoint me?

But it's hard because you bring out the worst in me
And all I want to do is hurt you
To make you feel the way that I feel
And I don't want to be this way
But I can't help but say what I need to say

Tried to do everything right
But I always get it wrong
Self-destruct because this drink's too strong
Every drop is honey to the muse that sings along
So here's a toast to you and my loneliness
A toast to the ghost and the demon enchantress
'Cause I've been seduced by the darkness again
The light is dimming this hole is sinking
And at this point 
I've got to stop thinking
That I'm so alone

(Back to Chorus)

And I know
You can't save me
You can't save me
'Cause I
I can't even save myself
No no I can't even save myself
Ooooh
