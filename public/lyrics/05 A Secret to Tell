05 A Secret to Tell

I've got a secret to tell but I won't tell anyone
'Cause why would I want to show you how deep my scars run
There's a darkness inside that I never could believe
Don't you know
You'll never really know me 'cause you'll

Run away
'Cause you'll
Run away

And I'll keep the thoughts to myself
Buried underneath
Fighting to surface
Drowning in the deep
If only I could show you
If only I could tell you
It wouldn't make a difference at all
'Cause I'll

Run away
'Cause you'll
Run away

And if I find that you stay
Well I'll be so inclined to leave
It's in my nature
'Cause it's one or the other
And I just don't
Trust myself with loving you

No no no no
