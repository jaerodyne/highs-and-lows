12 Insomnia

My mind is taking me over again
Going through all the possibilities
Don't think I'll ever get your voice out of my head
A guilty conscience feeds my insecurities

But I can't back down now

Oh insomnia
These sleepless nights take away all sanity
Oh insomnia
Stay awake 'cause you keep me up in the dead of night
All the way til the dawning of daylight

Tired 'cause I can't think about this anymore
Gotta find another distraction
I'm focusing on what I shouldn't
Fell apart 'cause I just couldn't
Keep it all together for so long

But I can't back down now

(Back to Chorus)
