13 Never Forget

One more drink
That's all it took
He grabbed the wheel
As his hands shook
The coldness of the devil
Breathing him in
Consuming all the fight that's within

Losing focus
Blackened skies
Early morning
To sunrise
It all happened so fast 
and then time stood still
As the rushing of blood to the head knocked him dead
And it's lights out
Lights out
Lights out

Never forget
That it matters
Never forget
What you what you did
Never forget
I'll never let you live it down

And it feels like forever
Recovering from a big mistake
Faced with your mortality
Forgetting its fragility
But we all lose touch sometimes
(We all lose touch sometimes)
It could be our own demise
(It could be our own demise)

We're not invincible that's for sure
And that's just the way it goes
It goes
It goes

Every moment has a consequence
Stealing away all the innocence
Of a life so pure
Of a life so pure
Now it's tainted by a memory
Of you just washing over me
Do you even know?
How could you ever really know?
Could you ever really know?
