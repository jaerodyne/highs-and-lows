# Highs and Lows
An interactive website built as exclusive extra content for an artist album.

## Description
This website is meant as accompanying content to my band(Jillian Somera and the Beta Option)'s debut album, Highs and Lows. 

It was built using HTML/CSS, React, React-Scroll, and React-ChartJS-2 to display a visualization of the album's tempo markings. The album is currently in progress, as is this website.
